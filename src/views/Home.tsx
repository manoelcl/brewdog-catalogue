          This website is a homage to the beers of Brewdog. We use the data
          provided by the <a href="https://punkapi.com/">Punk API</a>, a cool
          project which have collected data of this brewery creations. I hope
          that you enjoy searching and discovering new beers.

        <h2>Goals of this project</h2>
        <p>
          This project was intended to be a React.js practice. I wanted to
          create a website that allowed people to search in a beer API, giving
          them useful information. This website allows you to search beers by
          bitterness and alcohol but also by color. Though colour isn't such an
          important part of the beer, many people preferences are visual, so I
          created an interface with a strong visual focus
